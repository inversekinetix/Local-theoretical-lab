Nowadays, my most active area of research is fusion plasmas and turbulence. Still working on AGN jets and Solar coronal heating, and magnetic buoyancy. At the moment, the independent time left after daily physics read, increase/decrease understanding the auroral energy spectra say all that is need to say.More than twenty years ago, in 1989, I was doing high speed photography of freely suspended liquids, when was hired as Research Associate in Solid State Physics with Prof. Brongersma (ICTP). Recently, I was offer to join the JPCM Editorial Board, and the position is really stimulating my theory of the relaxation to stationary state, following my paper [put at arXiv arxiv] (PRE,57,0612,96,085,154; JSTAT,96,7,03029,10). Dr. M Alegre, now at CIESP-IBS, has also a paper about this subject.Independent of my main line, I accomplished completely developed in four months a book -about machine languages- with Dr. K. Khan, another Gwanghwfluence professor at Sungkyunkwan University. This book was recommended by Prof. B. Bronson (Univ Michigan), and the chapters have been self-published online.Today, the independent time left after microscope readings is pushing me to do other work, and I still continue with Brongersma about the ice meridians, the fluid impalement, the microbial pressure, the concentration and the velocity dispersion of tracers and so forth.Sungkyunkwan University, http://skku.edu.cn/skku/news/jinz2015.html</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am a theoretical physicist working on quantum gravity phenomenology. My line of research is a gaptargeted specifically at black hole physics, in particular to look for observational signature of event-horizons - an object (vacuum polarization, zero-point energy) occupying spacetime surrounding a black hole using the most recent theoretical research, and also to try to determine, what is the physics at the horizon of a black hole (at present time). As you already mentioned, currently there are lots of people who do new research on black holes, but the thing is they are just people with paper-long mathematical models/theories, and they don&#39;t really know much about the physics of black holes. So it is crucial to find intelligent people from outside, who have enough astrophysics, but also have enough mathematical skills to actually visualize the difference between two different models/theories. I am very lucky that my skills and experience matched lots of the current researchers simultaneously in this field (in particular working on Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, AdS/CFT, quantum gravity and quantum mechanics, and also my previous research which was also in a general relativity context). So I can see a very clear difference between two competing theories, and try to provide a physical situation/experimental context to understand the edge/limitations/physical predictions of our models. So it was apparent already from the very beginning that looking for parity violation is the next thing I want to do. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Disclaimer: I&#39;m not from the physical sciences myself, and I don&#39;t trust my knowledge of Indian history/culture.

There are many other areas in theoretical physics, from the strong force to cosmology, or statistical physics, but when I say my research interests, this is the most important. The reason that these problems are important to me is that I think that understanding them better could help us discover some area of physics that we don&#39;t even know exists. This is one of the reasons for my love for research in theoretical physics, all the wild speculations can be tested if we&#39;ve built the right instruments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am a theoretical high energy physicist.Let me describe the highest impact research I know of in my field.(Everything here comes from a few hours of reading-up.)The Standard Model of particle physics is a self-consistent theoretical model.But it&#39;s only made of the weak interaction and the Dirac equation.In addition to the electromagnetic and strong forces, as currently understood, there are naturally occurring fields permeating all of spacetime known as the gluon, the left-right crossing Z-boson and the 750 GeV spinless new boson call&#39;d the Higgs.This is an important fact as,clearly, with regard to consistency,it would have to have the spin of a Fermion,or a boson.This is the only new particle predicted by the Standard Model that we know about.The LHC at CERN is hunting for not only the expected Higgs but its other proposed brethren.To understand this fully will completely resolve some of the big open puzzles in physics and is a goal of my own research.The main sheet of this qed-sprint is being called Grand Unification and sits in the early universe where we see that all the forces are coming together over a short period of time in what is labeled &quot;Precision String Theory&quot;.The main active research in this field is trying to see if this Grand Unification fits the currently claimed cosmological parameters and lies at the heart of the dark energy and dark matter puzzles.The second biggest problem in physics is to understand the three completely different actions of the electromagnetic,weak and strong forces.These are completely independent in the math.We could always hope that somehow they follow some unified treatment between themselves,as the four forces of nature.This is the subject of Gauge Theory.The strong is the glue and is responsible for holding together the hadrons inside of us,left to the physical.The electromagnetic is the reason that we can communicate wirelessly with our cellphones without rungs.The weak is what drives the second (mis-spelled as propulsion) problems with the LHC and controls the radioactive decay. These are intertwined in almost every equation,physics book and lecture I know of.The frontier of physics,officially the Higgs&#39; in my sub-discipline of physics,is to find the electric charge&#39;s explanation as the symmetries of electrodynamics grows and is bent by BRS relativity which,in its turn,leads to General Relativity at the speed of light,or Gravitational BRS symmetry.This is called GUT Bell&#39;s moats.There is tons of other active topics as well,I hope I remembered to mention just a few of the more up-to-date ideas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why I and some one commented similar for Sheldon care for string theory based models?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Proton is $\sim$1000 times heavy than electron, and normal QED only explains heavy charged particle phenomenon and can not explain thin spectrum phenomena in chemistry and materials science.

We only focus on theories that can make testable predictions and are compatible with all observations.For this reason, graduate schools are going through a bit of a crisis as the Large Hadron Collider snatches a lot of the limelight and still produces a lot of relatively uninteresting, undetectable particles.However, I do find that all my roles, both as a teacher and now as a researcher, would have been seriously hindered without a thorough theoretical framework. I have never done experiments and without a robust understanding of axiomatic mathematics I would hardly be comfortable moving house (for example) without a solid grasp of Euclidean geometry. Ideally I would like to one day be as well qualified to answer the same question about gravity as Albert Einstein&#39;s opinion was on the matter: &quot;Gentlemen, in my opinion the main obstacle in the way of a research are the Gentlemen; as far as the lady are concerned; those are not there.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are, of course, many hard things to understand. I believe that is one of the main reasons why AI still has not managed to create a &quot;self-awareness&quot; yet. Algorithms are not self-aware and do not have a perspective about their experience (self-awareness requires an outside observer to have a perspective that can be judged). To invent an AI that understands the universe it is necessary to invent new algorithms that can deal with real quantity and that can be combined in very complex ways to produce new insights. The general purpose computer can be designed to think. For instance it can be designed to think within the same logical system (in which search for solutions might be done by logic deduction) that would be present in biological system (in which perception, decision and reaction are thought to be mainly performed by neural networks.) A major part of designing such AI would be to construct a method to run thousands and tens of thousands of thinking programs at the same time and assign each to a subprocess of a thinking program.If an AI job is really just to &quot;make decisions&quot; just as a human is, then the problem is very different. But, unfortunately, humans are obsessed with making consistent and correct decisions.It can also be the case that there are aspects of decision making that are beyond a human intelligence capability. These are hallucinations and goo. A minor example is that a human decision will err if it is heavily confounded by human emotions. That is why there are studies (and many screen images and ads) to show people solving a mathematical problem with an illuminating facial expression and to demonstrate that the emotion can cloud good judgment.Lastly, I strongly recommend Richard Hamming&#39;s &quot;some public lecture&quot; about the &quot;Art of Doing Science&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lRbZZ6mp_w</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where he discusses how it is impossible to understand real science without some scientific study of the subject.
